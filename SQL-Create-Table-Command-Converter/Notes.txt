// SHOULD NOT BE COMMITTED TO THE GITHUB REPO

=============== WAY OF IMPLEMENTING ===============
- 1 .xlsx sheet contains all the tables to be converted
- If Foreign Key is "Yes", create a Foreign Key statement and append to tempList
- If tempList is not empty, iterate through it and write to file
- If the
- Check whether end of file has reached

===================================================

if foreign key == yes:
	append FOREIGN KEY STATEMENT to foreign key list
at the end of the part, add the foreign key statement

Indicator that end of file has reached - the row in which the first 2 columns are empty strings [use max_row() to find the no. of records in a .xlsx file]

=============== EXAMPLE FORMULA TO SHOW THE USER INPUT IN "TABLES" COLUMN (BUT IT DOESNT WORK, REQUIRES REVISION) ===============
=Data Dictionary!$A$2:INDEX(Data Dictionary!$A$2:$A$1000,SUMPRODUCT(--(Data Dictionary!$A$2:$A$1000<>"")))
